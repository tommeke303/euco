Ari Epstein has been leading the Antwerp diamond industry for the past 5 years. Confucius once said: “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” “And that is exactly how I feel about my job every single day”, Ari smiles.

<br>“My father worked in the diamond industry, just like many others in the Jewish community”, Ari explains. “He was a diamond polisher and I truly admired the craftsmanship of his work. When my father used to come home from work he always spoke with such passion and pride with regards to diamonds and I think I inherited that admiration from an early age, and that still drives me in my job today.

<br>When Diamond Office, the controlling organ that is in charge of processing the imports and exports of all diamonds in Antwerp, was looking for a new Director, Ari did not hesitate a second. “A match made in heaven! With my academic background I could pursue my passion in an industry that has always fascinated me”, says Ari. “The combination of glitter & glamour, the international character and all the different cultures working together within a square mile is unique.”

<br>For 5 years now, Ari has been the CEO of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, and our mission is to ensure that Antwerp remains at the forefront of the global diamond industry. “A day in the life of a CEO is never the same” he says, “I am responsible for the general development of the diamond industry, maintaining contacts with various political stakeholders, motivating and monitoring the local as well as international market as well as the international arena whilst trying to optimize existing procedures as well as guaranteeing the safety of the industry.”</p>

<ul class="entry-meta clearfix">
    <li>Antwerp first</li>
</ul><br>
What Ari finds especially unique about ‘his’ industry, is the inherent connection that diamonds have with Antwerp. “I am an academic and am fascinated by the city archives filled to the brim with stories about the diamond industry. We have been connected to this city for over 550 years. Who else is able to say that?”

<br>Ari is really looking forward to the Diamond Year that will be organized next fall by the city of Antwerp, where various events will take place related to the diamond industry. “We are as connected to the city of Antwerp, just like diamonds are connected to the earth,” says Ari. “Therefore it was about time that we celebrated this unique and strong connection with various festivities.”

<br>During the Diamond Year the new diamond experience centre DiVA will open her doors, where diamonds will be showcased throughout ‘Winter in Antwerp’, a treasure hunt will be organized throughout the entire city and couples will be able to celebrate the eternal connection between love and diamonds with a extravagant Valentine themed cocktail. “In other words, our story has not been fully written yet. Every day our mission is to proudly reminisce on our 550 years of history whilst working hard and passionately to ensure our future.”

            <div class="entry-content">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">25-year old Melissa Smet is the youngest of our 16 Diamonds and Antwerp ambassadors. Melissa works as a legal expert for the State Holiday Trust for the Diamond Industry (Rijksverlofkas voor de diamantnijverheid). She knows all there is to know about the statutes and working conditions in the Antwerp diamond industry. Growing up in Antwerp, she had never walked through the streets of the diamond industry. “I studied law in Antwerp, but never set foot beyond Central Station and, to be honest, I was not even aware of the existence of the 1,700 specialized diamond companies in this one km2”, says Melissa.

<br>As legal expert, she works to safeguard the social benefits of all employees in the diamond industry. “But we are also involved in educating and training students so we can make sure that young people have opportunities in the diamond industry.”

<br>“At the secondary school ‘Municipal Lyceum Meir’, we invested in new equipment so that students who study polishing can use the latest technology throughout their coursework”, explains Melissa. “In addition, we also organize basic courses for the unemployed, some of whom eventually found a job in the diamond industry”, says Melissa. “These are some of the causes we care about and invest in”, she says proudly.

<br>“Despite the fact that the majority of diamonds are polished in India today, the most exceptional and special stones are polished in Antwerp and we need good polishers here. Therefore, training and education is important,” says Melissa.

<br>“Looking ahead to the upcoming Diamond Year, we are working on developing a quality label for diamonds that are polished in Antwerp. We don’t have the full details yet, but it is something we would like to elaborate more on towards the Diamond Year, which will take place in September 2017 – October 2018.”

<br>Meanwhile, in the run-up to this festive period, Melissa is also serving as a member of various working groups set up to prepare for the Diamond Year. “Since I knew so little about the existence of the diamond industry, and having come to realize it is such a fascinating and beautiful environment, I truly hope that the Diamond Year will open the eyes of the Antwerp people and everyone will re-discover what a brilliant industry is hiding in the shadows of Antwerp Central Station.”

<br>From September on, Melissa will take up a new professional challenge with the Syndicate of the Belgian Diamond Industry (SBD), which is a professional association of Belgian and foreign diamond companies located in Belgium.

                    Samir Mehta is originally from Palanpur India and next to being ambassador of the Antwerp diamond industry, he also represents the large Indian community here. Samir’s story is similar to that of many diamantaires from the Indian community. “I learned the business in India and then came to Antwerp: the world center for diamonds.”

              27 years ago Samir came to Antwerp after he learned everything about the diamond business in his uncle’s factory. There he learned how to polish and sort diamonds. Then he went to Surat to learn how to sort rough diamonds and finally he arrived to Mumbai, where he learned cleaving, which is the process of breaking a stone and manufacturing a diamond.

              “My uncle, brothers and nephews all work in the diamond industry”, Samir says. Our family is one big international organization”, Samir laughs. “Some are based in New York, others in Mumbai, Shanghai and Dubai and I was lucky enough to come to Antwerp.</p>

      <ul class="entry-meta clearfix">
      <li>Stories and people</li>
      </ul><br>
      In 1988, I started working for the company Horizon Diamond before I started my own company, Sneh Diam in 1993. “Those were the golden years,” says Samir. Even though I came from India, through building up a network, meeting the right people and knowing where to buy my stones, I could start making money. The diamond business is based on stories and people and that is what makes it such a special industry.

Back in the day, you did not need much education to work here. Knowing the right people and where to get your stones was enough. “I don’t have a university degree, but I know how to greet people in the industry correctly, even in Hebrew”, Samir laughs. “My education comes from speaking to people on the street. That is the magic of the square mile”.</p>
<ul class="entry-meta clearfix">
<li>We call it mazal</li>
</ul><br>
Samir compares the diamond business to art. Before complicated machinery and technology existed, we only had a lens to determine a stone’s value. And even if the industry has seen many changes over the years, Samir remains very passionate. “Even if so many bad things happen in the world, people still trust each other. “We call it mazal or handshaking,” he explains. In our industry, everyone is international, there are over 72 nationalities here and we all get along. When hiring someone, we don’t conduct a standard interview, but we try to get to know the person, his background as well as his family values. That is how we know if the person is right for the job or not.”

<ul class="entry-meta clearfix">
<li>The next generation</li>
</ul><br>
People who don’t have any affinity with our industry rarely start working as a diamantaire. “The next generation is already underway”, Samir says. “Sons and grandsons of older diamantaires. They are educated, often have a business degree and are aware of the newest technologies on the market. That is how the industry is slowly changing. The industry that used to be based on craftsmanship is now shifting and is making room for technological expertise and know-how. We go along with our time and think more globally now. But despite its global character, everything related to diamonds still starts and ends in Antwerp.”
