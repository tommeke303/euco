                    <div class="entry-content"><strong>by Jan Huygens, E.R.I.C. Founder</strong><p></p><p><img class="alignright size-medium" src="http://rotaracteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2013/05/Jan_Huygens-199x300.jpg" alt="Jan_Huygens" srcset="http://rotaracteurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Jan_Huygens-199x300.jpg 199w, http://rotaracteurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Jan_Huygens.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" width="199" height="300">The first roots of Rotaract developed in Europe (especially Italy and Belgium) and Australia in the late fifties. The first “Paul Harris” clubs developed as clubs of young adults, children of Rotarians, who wanted to share the same ideals as their fathers. The movement become so important it drew the attention of RI and was officially adopted as a Rotary program in 1968, while the name of the clubs was changed into Rotaract. Since, Rotaract spread around the world, but it is obvious it developed the strongest organization in those countries where it existed for the longest period of time.</p><p>While the clubs developed and spread, the RI organization did not follow all developments very closely and as a consequence hardly offered any service to its program. In the meantime in Europe the organization had grown to such an extent that many international events were organized and a need for more information grew constantly in order to improve the contacts and interaction. European Rotary discerned these needs, so in 1985 and 1987 it invited Rotaractors from various countries to attend the bi-annual CIP meeting in Strasbourg in the European Parliament. The CIP (comité inter pays) meeting was a conference for Rotarians from around Europe who were active in the exchange between clubs. Rotaractors were invited to present the Rotaract program to the Rotarians as well as to discuss various Rotaract topics between themselves. The outcome of both meetings was that Rotaractors from around Europe felt there was a need to organize an annual European Rotaract conference and that a central secretariat was needed were all information on Rotaract was gathered so it could be easily exchanged.</p>
                    <p><img class="alignleft" src="http://rotaracteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2013/05/first-european-comittee-300x203.jpg" alt="first european comittee" srcset="http://rotaracteurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/first-european-comittee-300x203.jpg 300w, http://rotaracteurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/first-european-comittee.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" width="326" height="220">After that the development went very fast. When I was elected DRR of a Belgium district 2170 in mid-1987, I made it the major objective for the district to create this secretariat and to organize the first European Rotaract Convention. In March 1988 ERIC was created to be the central European Rotaract Information Center, based in Brussels. The Belgian Rotary offered to use their Brussels’ office as the official address for ERIC.&nbsp; To make this known around Europe, Belgian clubs organized the first European Conference in Antwerp, where 300 Rotaractors from 16 countries attended. At this conference the first European Committee was created with one representative per country.</p>
                    <p>In the initial years all the practical work of writing the newsletter, editing the directory, etc was done by a Belgian team presided by what we called in those days the General Coordinator.
                      From 1996 the team became international and the work was spread around Rotaractors from all over Europe.</p><p>In 1993 E.R.I.C. was officially recognized by Rotary International as a Multi-district Information Organisation thus becoming the first international MDIO in the Rotary world.</p></div>

                            That is the question we asked ourselves when brainstorming on the organization of the 30th edition of the European Rotaract Conference EuCo 2018 in Antwerp Belgium. An initiative by the three Rotary Districts in Belgium. Well, our organisation is built on the following three pillars, essential - so we believe strongly - when making the impossible happen!

                    <p>
                        Rotaract Belgium united! At first you should know that the concept of ‘Rotaract’ predates the initiative taken in the United States of America by 1968. The first notion of ‘Rotaract’ started in Belgium and Italy in the 1950’s, back then it was known as ‘Paul Harris Circles’. Young adults, children of Rotarians, who shared the same ideals and objectives as their fathers.

                    <p>
                        The rich history of Rotaract in these region, explains the popularity of the Rotaract community in Belgium. Our country split into three Rotary Districts; 1620, 2170 and 1630. The latter includes the country of Luxembourg. Together these Districts are over 52 clubs strong with an enthusiastic 1.235 Rotaract members. Besides being engaged locally, Belgian Rotaractors are known to be very active on an European level. A striking example was our presence during the EuCo 2017 in Warsaw, Poland with a total delegation of 103 Belgians present. Everyone knows a Belgian…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the 8th of April 2017 representatives of all Rotaract clubs in Belgium gathered in the city of Antwerp to support the EuCo 2018 bid by the non-profit association VZW EUCO 2018. The Host Organising Committee - staffed by members of all three Districts - got the endorsement of the Rotaract clubs in Belgium.

                    <h2>The City</h2>

                    <p>Let Antwerp amaze you!</p>

                    <p>
                        Museums, shops, architecture: whatever is on your city-trip checklist, Antwerp can offer, including a zoo.<br>
                        The Antwerp Zoo is one of Europe’s oldest and most attractive city zoos. And a beach: St Anneke, on the Left Bank.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Not only the beach is pretty unique for a city inland, the city also boasts a deep sea port 80 km inland. As you can see, Antwerp does everything that little bit differently.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Antwerp skyline, the Cathedral of Our Lady takes pride of place: it is the highest church spire in the Lowlands and is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Quite a feat for a building with just one finished spire. A little further up, MAS| Museum aan de Stroom stands out: in this Museum at the River, the most beautiful work of art may well be the view. From the 60-metre high roof top, you can admire the whole city.
                    </p>

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Beside the MAS, Antwerp offers many other special museums. In addition to their top collections, they all have that something extra: the Middelheim Museum is a park full of sculptures, in The Rubens House, you walk through a famous artist’s house and Plantin Moretus was the world’s first museum to feature on the World Heritage List.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And then there are the museum-grade buildings, where you can either shop or eat – as you do – like in the Neoclassical (shopping) Stadsfeestzaal that accommodates a shopping centre, a former chapel which houses star restaurant, and the Palace in Meir (once Napoleon’s) where you lunch or catapult cocoa up your nose when you order a chocolate shooter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        People from Antwerp set the trend. This is evident from the many pop-ups and start-ups, and also in the fashion and diamond districts, of course. You will find more diamonds in the Diamond Square Mile – where international diamond hallmarks originate – than in the rest of the world. And peppered all over the city are dazzling shop windows full of attractive jewellery designs. Antwerp sets the tone where fashion is concerned, too: couture is not just in the boutiques, but also on the streets, at the museum (MoMu) and at the college. The fashion department of the Royal Academy is one of the world’s most influential. Even today, great talents graduate from there, invariably starting their labels in the city.

                        Locals proudly refer to their city as cosmopolitan with a village atmosphere: you can find everything here, but always within walking, or at least cycling, distance (for which the Antwerp city bikes are available).

                        The city itself is also easy to reach. If you want a piece of advice: come by train. The majestic Antwerp Central railway station has won many beauty prizes … something that may dull the pain to some extent when the time comes to leave the city.

                        In 1988, at the initiative of former Rotaractor and current Rotarian Jan Huygens, the first Multi District Information Organisation (M.D.I.O.) was founded in the heart of Europe, Brussels, Belgium. The European Rotaract Information Centre (E.R.I.C.) was the first of its kind and until today the largest M.D.I.O. in the world. Belgium, as a beacon of the European thought, played a key role during the first years or E.R.I.C.

                        Where was the first European Rotaract Conference held? … That’s right! In Antwerp! Back in March 1988 the city hosted 300 Rotaractors from 16 different countries. At this conference the first Country Representatives were appointed.

                        Later on, in 2006, Antwerp hosted the European Conference a second time. At the end of this five-day event a spectacular closing gala was organised with close to 1.500 attendees. Let us bring back the EUCO to the place where it all started in 1988: Antwerp!

In 2018 Rotaract clubs around the world celebrate their fiftieth anniversary of the Rotaract program, celebrating their achievements and plan to take on new challenges.
