                      <p>“What is organisation of the next EuCo need in order to host an amazing edition?”</p>
                      <footer>That is the question we asked ourselves when brainstorming on the organization of the 30th edition of the European Rotaract Conference EuCo 2018 in Antwerp Belgium. An initiative by the three Rotary Districts in Belgium. Well, our organisation is built on the following three pillars, essential - so we believe strongly - when making the impossible happen!</footer>
                  </blockquote>

                <h2>The People</h2>

                Rotaract Belgium united! At first you should know that the concept of ‘Rotaract’ predates the initiative taken in the United States of America by 1968. The first notion of ‘Rotaract’ started in Belgium and Italy in the 1950’s, back then it was known as ‘Paul Harris Circles’. Young adults, children of Rotarians, who shared the same ideals and objectives as their fathers.

                <p><blockquote>The first Rotary club in Belgium was founded in 1923 in the capital Brussels.
                </blockquote></p>
                  The rich history of Rotaract in these region, explains the popularity of the Rotaract community in Belgium. Our country split into three Rotary Districts; 1620, 2170 and 1630. The latter includes the country of Luxembourg. Together these Districts are over 52 clubs strong with an enthusiastic 1.235 Rotaract members. Besides being engaged locally, Belgian Rotaractors are known to be very active on an European level. A striking example was our presence during the EuCo 2017 in Warsaw, Poland with a total delegation of 103 Belgians present. Everyone knows a Belgian…</p>

                  <p>On the 8th of April 2017 representatives of all Rotaract clubs in Belgium gathered in the city of Antwerp to support the EuCo 2018 bid by the non-profit association VZW EUCO 2018. The Host Organising Committee - staffed by members of all three Districts - got the endorsement of the Rotaract clubs in Belgium.</p>

                  <h2>The City</h2>

                  <p>Let Antwerp amaze you!</p>

                  <p>Museums, shops, architecture: whatever is on your city-trip checklist, Antwerp can offer, including a zoo.<br>
                  The Antwerp Zoo is one of Europe’s oldest and most attractive city zoos. And a beach: St Anneke, on the Left Bank.</p>

                  <p>Not only the beach is pretty unique for a city inland, the city also boasts a deep sea port 80 km inland. As you can see, Antwerp does everything that little bit differently.</p>

                  <h3><b><u>Enjoy the heights</b></u></h3>
                  <p>In the Antwerp skyline, the Cathedral of Our Lady takes pride of place: it is the highest church spire in the Lowlands and is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Quite a feat for a building with just one finished spire. A little further up, MAS| Museum aan de Stroom stands out: in this Museum at the River, the most beautiful work of art may well be the view. From the 60-metre high roof top, you can admire the whole city.</p>

                  <h3><b><u>Culture and gastronomy revisited</b></u></h3>
                  <p>Beside the MAS, Antwerp offers many other special museums. In addition to their top collections, they all have that something extra: the Middelheim Museum is a park full of sculptures, in The Rubens House, you walk through a famous artist’s house and Plantin Moretus was the world’s first museum to feature on the World Heritage List.</p>
                  <p>And then there are the museum-grade buildings, where you can either shop or eat – as you do – like in the Neoclassical (shopping) Stadsfeestzaal that accommodates a shopping centre, a former chapel which houses star restaurant, and the Palace in Meir (once Napoleon’s) where you lunch or catapult cocoa up your nose when you order a chocolate shooter.</p>

                  <h3><b><u>Cradle of diamond and fashion</b></u></h3>
                  <p>People from Antwerp set the trend. This is evident from the many pop-ups and start-ups, and also in the fashion and diamond districts, of course. You will find more diamonds in the Diamond Square Mile – where international diamond hallmarks originate – than in the rest of the world. And peppered all over the city are dazzling shop windows full of attractive jewellery designs.
                    Antwerp sets the tone where fashion is concerned, too: couture is not just in the boutiques, but also on the streets, at the museum (MoMu) and at the college. The fashion department of the Royal Academy is one of the world’s most influential. Even today, great talents graduate from there, invariably starting their labels in the city.</p>

                    <h3><b><u>XL range at an XS distance</b></u></h3>
                    <p>Locals proudly refer to their city as cosmopolitan with a village atmosphere: you can find everything here, but always within walking, or at least cycling, distance (for which the Antwerp city bikes are available).</p>

                    <blockquote class="quote"><p>Antwerp is a city the size of New Haven that’s as design-obsessed as Tokyo, coffee-crazed as Milan, and global as New York.</p>
                      <footer>Michael Kaminer, New York Daily News</footer></blockquote>

                    <p>The city itself is also easy to reach. If you want a piece of advice: come by train. The majestic Antwerp Central railway station has won many beauty prizes … something that may dull the pain to some extent when the time comes to leave the city.</p>
